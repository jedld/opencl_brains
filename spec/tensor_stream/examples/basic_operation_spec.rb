          # added as a node to the default graph.

          # Create a Matmul op that takes 'matrix1' and 'matrix2' as inputs.
          # The returned value, 'product', represents the result of the matrix
          # multiplication.
          product = TensorStream.matmul(matrix1, matrix2)

          # To run the matmul op we call the session 'run()' method, passing 'product'
          # which represents the output of the matmul op.  This indicates to the call
          # that we want to get the output of the matmul op back.
          #
          # All inputs needed by the op are run automatically by the session.  They
          # typically are run in parallel.
          #
          # The call 'run(product)' thus causes the execution of threes ops in the
          # graph: the two constants and matmul.
